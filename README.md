# ME5411_Computing Project in Matlab

This project is completed in Matlab to perform the required tasks. 
Mainly separated into 

Part1: Task 1~6 on pre-processing the original image **character2.bmp**

Part2: Task7 on training 2 classification systems to classify the segmented images from Part1, using training data from **dataset_2025**

Step 1.
Download this project

Step2.
Include the "dataset_2025" in Part2 folder

Step3a (CNN).
Run "runCNN" script to use Pre-trained models in "Save_models" to visualize the prediction result of the model on the dataset and part1 images

Step3b (SVM).
Run "runSVM" script to use Pre-trained models to visualize the prediction result of the model on the dataset and part1 images

Step4 (Optional)
Use "simpleCNN" and "AdvanceCNN" to train models and also perform evaluation within the scripts.

Classification Results for the segmented characters can be found in "Part2/Results"
